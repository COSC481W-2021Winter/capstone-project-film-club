Tyler is a movie enthusiast.  But because he has viewed so many films on his streaming services he has run out of new material.  He also wishes to have a more honest opinion on what he might like given the corporate bias the streaming services have when they recommend their new material to him.  He also wants to connect with a growing social media community that shares similar interests and become part of a larger community. Tyler values his family members and close friends who like to spend time watching movies on a regular basis. He also values the recommendations/suggestions he receives from other users so that they can discuss/have friendly conversations about various topics relating to film and television.
